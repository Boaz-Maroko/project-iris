# Introduction
Welcome to Project Iris! This is a machine learning application developed as a school project. As a result, it currently has limited features.

# Features
The program allows data cleaning and clustering, which can then be used to train an AI model for classifying future unlabelled data.

## 1. Loading Excel and CSV Data
The application supports loading and displaying both Excel and CSV files in its main window.

To load data, go to the menu bar, select **Cluster**, and then choose the relevant submenu based on your data type.

## 2. Clustering the Data
If the data loads successfully, a **Cluster** button will appear at the bottom right of the screen.

Clicking this button opens a pop-up window where you can select columns containing **numerical values** for feature clustering. After selecting the appropriate columns, click **Done**.

## 3. Training the AI
To train the AI model, go to the menu, select **Train**, and choose the appropriate format depending on your data type.

The program will indicate whether the training was successful and display the modelâ€™s accuracy percentage. The ideal accuracy should be **90% or higher**.
